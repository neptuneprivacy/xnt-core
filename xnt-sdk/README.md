**xnt-core** is the reference implementation for **xnt (Neptune Privacy)** — a privacy-focused decentralized digital cash protocol derived from Neptune Cash.

##

The XNT SDK provides the core tools needed to build applications that interact with the network without custody.

This includes offline transaction signing, so private keys never leave the client or trusted environment.

Why this matters:
Most privacy apps today still depend on custodial backends, trusted relayers, or opaque infrastructure.

The XNT SDK enables applications where users remain in full control, end-to-end.

The SDK is open source and intended as foundational infrastructure for:
- wallet developers
- application builders
- tooling teams
- anyone building on private execution

Builders, the next phase is in your hands.

We’ll continue improving the SDK and releasing updates as the ecosystem grows.
If you’re building privacy preserving applications and care about non-custodial design, this is for you!
